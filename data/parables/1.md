# The path of Jahmolxes

- [intro-1]: On his way to the mountains to meditate, Jahmolxes once came across a strange {{road}}, beginning from within the forest.
- [intro-2]: How these lands still hold such little secrets, Jahmolxes thought.
    He smiled and entered the {{forest}} to take the new route.
- [intro-3]: The road was steep and narrow, and grew more so with each {{step}}.
- [intro-4]: After many turns and climbs, Jahmolxes came upon a small glade, surrounded by tall pines.
    Though feeling inspired by the clearing's playful {{lights}}, he also thought about the {{journey}} lying ahead...

- [intro-glade-1]: Following the thin rays of light that bathed the glade, Jahmolxes saw that the trees had formed a perfect circle, at the center of which stood a stone {{well}}.
    All the light seemed to be pointing to it ...
- [intro-glade-2]: He approached the well and gazed into it .

- [intro-road-1]: Jahmolxes followed the road ahead until it came to an abrupt {{end}}.
- [intro-road-2]: The forest had become sparse by this point, so it could be passed by foot in order to {{advance}} .
- [intro-road-3]: Large rock formations rised here and there, more frequently as he wondered deeper into the woods .
    Finally, Jahmolxes came across the mountain's thick {{walls}}, reaching far up to the sky .

- [intro-road-4]: There, Jahmolxes noticed an entrance in the mountain, a large arch that looked like it had been built .
